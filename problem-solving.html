    <h1>My approach to proplem solving</h1>
      <ul>
          <li><h4>The time I got blocked on a simple Problem</h4></li>
          <p>A couple of months before foundations had started, I was emersed in self directed study, trying my best to learn as much as I could
              to try and build an understanding of how a webpage is created. So I thought it maybe a good idea to build one myself,
              long story short, the webpage eventually started to come to something but wasn't very exciting, after some research I found a mini project which was some bouncing balls
              which I thought looked pretty cool and thought that they would add something fun to my webpage, so I followed a tutorial on how to do it only to come to the end of the tutorial
              to find that it did not work but it did for the guy demonstrating it. I had two options one would be to got back throught the tutorial and restart all over again, the second would be
              to try figure this out for myself which is what I decided to do. The first step in solving this issue was for me to get familiar with error messages and build an understanding of what they meant
              so after a bit of research I now had a bit of an idea of what had happened, as it turned out it was something that I had missed which was a little bit of a relief.
              I went through everything jotting down off the top of my head what it could be that is missing, then something clicked, the HTML document needed to be parsed fully in order for the the javascript code 
              to implement the animation which made total sense even though I really had no idea why, in the script tag I put defer src instead of just src and it worked.
              I got pretty fustrated throughout that senario but had determination to get it sorted and new I would feel a sense of achievment after it had been solved.
              I then realised and learned that even when you follow a tutorial by an experienced developer they also can make mistakes or in this case leave something out so always be prepared to
              face solving a problem when you least expecdt it.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h4></li>
            <p>Pseudocode for me is something that will take a bit of getting used to, mainly due to the fact that I'm so usee to mapping everything out in my head before doing it.
                Just going ahead and trying something is a technique I'm kinda used to and I am not afraid of.
                Reading error messages is very important as they do tell you what is wrong, at the start they do look scary but I think its 
                important to know what they mean.
                Console.logging is another technique which is very handy and im now getting quite used to using, although I do sometimes struggle to 
                know when the best time is to use it efficiently.
                Googling Is one of my main tools I use, the most important thing is to know what to google specifically.
                Asking peers for help is definately something I need to work on, mainly due to my past career paths I don't always think to do it but 
                will be making sure I do it more often and feel comfortable doing it.
                I'm always find myself reflecting on my processes towards problem solving and thinking of ways to improve them in the future, some of the techniques 
                mentioned above are completely new to me, once I build a bit of confidence with them I will start utilising them more often.
