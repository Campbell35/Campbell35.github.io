        <p>My long term goal is to become a full stack devolper.</p>
        <li><h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3></li>

        <p>I would like to develop some good teamwork skills that are related to the industry.</p>

        <p>Demonstrate respect while working with others, set myself and commit to deadlines, will try my best not to be too much of a perfectionist, track time for individual tasks </p>
        <p>If things start to build up and start getting to me I'll take a step back and write a list of everything I have to do in order to release some of the pressure, talk to a facilitator or counsellor</p>
        <li><h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3></li>
        <p>I will ensure that I seek help when I can no longer find a solution for a current task etc or have any questions realting to the task at hand</p>
        <li><h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3></li>
        <p>I would expect some sort of guidence if needed and be there as support.</p>
