        <li><h4>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h4></li>
        <p>EQ or emotional quotient, is a persons abilty to identify, express and control emotions.
            People with a high EQ usually make great team players because of their ability to understand
            and connect to people around them.
        </p>
        <p>IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify an individuals ability to learn, understand
            and apply information to skills.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</h4></li>
        <p>I believe emotional itelligence is important to any team enviroment, for those who are in leadership type roles, being able to understand
            and support their fellow peers through any situation that could arise and to enable stability and certainty to all involved is paramount to maintaining a
            healthy team.
           Having people with the ability to identify and control ones emotions and assess others' emotions in a team would be
           a huge asset to creating a happy and harmonious working enviroment and to know personally that there is someone with those skills working along side you
           gives you confidence and motivation to be the best you can be.
