    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <p>After leaving high school I chose to embark on a career path as a chef, which at the time was known as the industry
        for drop outs and misfits, but on the other hand its an indutry which teaches you core values to survive in a setting that is of extremly high pressure
     both mentally and phyically.</p>
    <p>On my first at my first paid job I was confronted with a decision which will be with me for the rest of my life and really opened my eyes to how an enviroment
        like that can cause one of the toughest in the industry to lose it due to the high pressure enviroment.
        This particular person was classified as an industry dinosaur, they had worked in some of the best restaurants in the country and was known nationally for his
        contributions to the industry. During work they were as hard as nails and would curse at you if he had to, after work they were one of the sweetest people you'd ever meet.
        On this particular occasion the esbalishment was extremly busy and it was in the middle of summer, which is a very tough mix of circumstances, to put in perspective we were
        working over hot grills, element, ovens etc while trying to cook for over 400 diners all wanting their meals to a high standard with in a reasonably short amount of time in temperatures
        exceeding 40 degrees celcius.
        As we were entering the middle of the shift something clicked and caused this person who was responsible for the wellbeing of us the staff and the customers, to lash out in extreme anger,
        towards one particular staff member which resulted in them going to hospital for medical care.
        This left the whole team bewildered that someone of that stature who had so much respect amongst his peers could behave in such a way, during the aftermath, all of us were in a position where
        we would have to give evidence to law enforcment regarding their actions ultimatley leading to a tarnished reputation and arrest,
        all of the others in the team chose to lie and save his reputation, which left me with two choices one being to lie like the others and risk another event happening to someone else and
        in turn save his reputation or two tell the truth with a strong possiblity of arrest and the to his career from now on. I chose to do what came naturally to me which is to tell the truth
        regardless of what may happen, which ultimatley led to the inevitable.
        <p>What I learned from this experience and a few others, is that these experiences shape who you are as a person and how you treat others. If I had'nt had these experiences I most likley would of turned like the 
            person mentioned earlier. Later on in my career I found that I did things alot differently than my industry idols and learned that if you treat people with respect you'll get respect in return, if your kind to people
            it makes the most stressful of situations alot easier to cope with and if you help those that need it regardless of their position the team will appreciate it.
