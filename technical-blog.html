    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
    <p>In simple form classes should be used if you would like to use similar stylings to a variety
        of elements on your page. For example, on my home page I have used a class name for the header element
        of my page, which would allow me to use similar declarations if was to do a footer of my page. However if I used an ID
        the declarations used for the header can only be used once on that page, therefore I can not reuse them.</p>

    Take an iPod in a store. On the packaging will be a bar code. This tells the store what the product is, so when it is scanned, the system knows exactly what the product is and what it costs. It might even be able to know what color it is or where it was kept in the store. All iPod of this same type have the exact same bar code on them.

The iPod will also have a serial number on it which is absolutely unique to any other iPod (or any other device) in the world. The serial number doesn’t know the price. It could, but for the store this wouldn’t be a very efficient way to store and use that data. It would be much easier to use the barcode, so that for example, if the price changed, you could just change the price for that bar code and not every individual serial number in your system.

This is much like ID’s and Classes. Information that is reuseable should be kept in a class and information that is totally unique should be kept in an ID.
