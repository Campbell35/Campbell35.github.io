    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset and how it influences your learning</h1>
    <p>I think of Neuroplasticity as an understanding of how the brain adapts to change when learning new things,
        partaking in activities such as gaming, learning musical intruments, exercise can all be used to enhance neuroplasticity
        by improving co-ordination, focus, memory in general and building muscle memory.
        I've been learning and playing music for quite sometime now, through this study I now realise how important it has been
        in developing my focus, patience and motor co-ordination skills over the years.
         </p>
         <p>Growth Mindset has been a very important aspect of my life, personally I love learning my brain craves for it all the time,
             but in saying that there has to be some sort of passion or motivation for it to be effective otherwise it just becomes what I call
             useless knowledge. When it comes to learning new skills I think the most important thing to do is to work out how you learn most effectivly.
             Trying to get inspired by people who have been successful in the area your starting out in is one way to drive motivation and eventually
             it will become passion.
