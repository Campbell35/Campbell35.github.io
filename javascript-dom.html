    <h1>A Reflection of What I Have Learned!!</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Javascript and its relationship with HTML and CSS</h4></li>
        <p>The best way to describe the relationship is to think of all of them as part of a city block,
            inside that city block are different buildings, some of which are residential houses others may be eateries,
            bank and a mall. If you look at this city block from a helicopter view each building just looks like differentsized squares,
            but when you zoom in closer you'll notice each building group looks different, the residential buildings have thier own look about them,
            and so does the bank and the mall (When relating this to a website this would be the HTML, the structure of the page itself).
            Now if we land the helicopter and visit these buildings we'll notice the interior and exterior of the buildings (Which would the the equivelent to CSS),
            And when we are inside these buildings we notice that each has certain functions the visitors can perform (This would be the JavaScripts role on a website).
        </p>
        <li><h4>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h4></li>
        <p>As a trained chef I tend to relate control flow to following a recipe, which its sole purpose is to achieve repeatable results in a kitchen,
            unfortunatley one has to minimise choices in order for it to be successful. A refined recipe is generally followed step by step with little to no variation.
            Occasionally there will be choices eg: "substitute butter for coconut oil" or "season to taste" but primarily is a list of steps to follow in order.
            Loops, arrays and objects if thought of as ingredients all play a different role in the functionality of the application or website</p>
        <li><h4>Functions and why they are useful</h4></li>
        <p>Functions are in simple form reusable blocks of code, which allow us to do useful things without having to write all that code yourself.
            Javascript has many built-in function that can be utilised. </p>
        <li><h4>The DOM and DevTools</h4></li>
        <p>The DOM can be thought of as ones genealogical tree, which starts with the first known ancesters from whom it states its children and from there those children
            get married and have children of their own and it keep going until we get to the most recent, each one of those people on that tree has information about them that may
            not be immediately visible on the tree and therefore would require some sort of tool (DevTools) to allow us to gain access to that information. </p>
    
    </ul>
