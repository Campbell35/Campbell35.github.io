    <h1>Looking Back on Foundations</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4></li>
        <p>I have learned that having patience is the key, my ego can get in the way at the best of times so trying to suppress it when necessary 
            is important, I do have some social skills.
        </p>
        <li><h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4></li>
        <p>
            I think values and empathy play a huge role in learning programming, being aware that everyone learns differently, Sometimes
            people may see things differently to you, all these things are important to team work which is a big part of programming.
        </p>
        <li><h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4></li>
        <p>
            How important it is to programming.
        </p>
        <li><h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4></li>
        <p>The journey of self discovery was definatley one of the more challenging aspects for me.</p>
        <li><h4>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4></li>
        <p>In an intense enviroment like a bootcamp its important that people learn to develop some of these skills and are aware of how important they are,
            stressful enviroments can have varying effects on different people.
        </p>
        <li><h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4></li>
        <p>To be honest at the start I thought it was a bit of a waste of time but now I see how important it is and how beneficial it can be in the future.
            Programming is only one piece of the puzzle, being a participating member of a team is another of equal importance.
